olareg (pronounced oh-la-reg) is a minimal OCI conformant container registry.
It is designed around the OCI Layout structure for storing images in a directory.
The minimal nature includes avoiding external dependencies, making the project easy to embed in unit tests or deployed in an edge environment as a cache.

It may be deployed as a container image, a standalone binary, or used as a Go package.
See the [installation instructions](./install) for more details.
